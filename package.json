    "description": "AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a\npipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of scheduling and ensuring that\ndata dependencies are met so that your application can focus on processing the\ndata.\n\nAWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a task runner called AWS Data\nPipeline Task Runner. AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for common\ndata management scenarios, such as performing database queries and running data\nanalysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use AWS Data\nPipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your own task runner\nto provide custom data management.\n\nAWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality. Use the first set\nto create a pipeline and define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the\ntransforms to be performed on the data. Use the second set in your task runner\napplication to receive the next task ready for processing. The logic for\nperforming the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis, or\nconverting the data from one format to another, is contained within the task\nrunner. The task runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service,\nreporting progress to the web service as it does so. When the task is done, the\ntask runner reports the final success or failure of the task to the web service.",
